# Python Snake Game: An Object-Oriented Approach

This project presents a classic game of "Snake" implemented using Python's `pygame` module. The game features a grid-based game window with a snake that moves around, consuming fruits that appear randomly on the screen. As the snake eats these fruits, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Game's Codebase

- **SNAKE Class**: Represents the snake, handling its graphics, movement, and growth.
- **FRUIT Class**: Represents the fruit, handling its random placement on the screen.
- **MAIN Class**: Manages the game, including the game loop, updating game states, collision detection, and rendering game elements.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The game is implemented entirely in Python, demonstrating its potential for developing interactive applications.
- **Pygame**: This Python library is used for creating the game window, handling input events, and managing the game's visual elements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The codebase follows OOP principles, featuring classes like `SNAKE`, `FRUIT`, and `MAIN`, making the code modular, scalable, and maintainable.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    git clone https://github.com/DonYoon/snake.git

2. **Change to the project directory**:

    cd snake

3. **Install the required package**:

    pip install pygame

5. **Run the game**:

    python main.py

6. **Enjoy playing the Sanke game!**
